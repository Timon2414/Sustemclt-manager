## Download
* **[Binary releases](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig/releases)**
* **[Build from source](https://xmrig.com/docs/miner/build)**

## Usage
The preferred way to configure the miner is the [JSON config file](https://xmrig.com/docs/miner/config) as it is more flexible and human friendly. The [command line interface](https://xmrig.com/docs/miner/command-line-options) does not cover all features, such as profiles for different algorithms. Important options can be changed during runtime without restart by editing the config file or executing calls.
